Have a Safe Flight: Bon Voyage
------------------------------

By Mariela Buchin, WonRon Cho, and Scott Fisher

Abstract
--------

This is the creation of a "smart flight vest" that detects movements from a human body and translates them into parameters that determine the pitch and roll of an airplane in flight. The throttle of the plane is determined by a pressure sensor located under the pilot's foot. The pilot flying the plane stands in front of a monitor that displays the main features of an airplane console, including an attitude indicator, a compass, and an altitude and vertical velocity display.

There are two devices imbedded in the flight vest to detect the horizontal and forward tilt of the upper body of the pilot, corresponding to the roll and pitch of the plane. The outputs of these devices are converted to digital signals and sent to a physics module that determines the orientation, altitude, direction, vertical velocity, and position of the airplane.
