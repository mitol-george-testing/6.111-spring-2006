"Let's Take This Outside" Boxing
--------------------------------

By David Blau, Uzoma Orji, and Reesa Phillips

Abstract
--------

"Let's Take This Outside" Boxing is a one player or two player game in which fighter box to the death. The user interface is comprised of a camera and gloves equipped with accelerometers. The camera detects the position of the gloves and the accelerometers measure the force of a punch. The position of the boxer is inferred from the on-screen coordinates of the gloves. When a punch is detected, the control unit determines whether the punch hit the opponent and how forceful it was. The more forceful the punch, the more damage is done. The game continues until one player loses all her life. The output displays an image of the gloves and the opponent and health meter. The fighters, their health meters, and the boxing ring are drawn using sprites read from ROM.
